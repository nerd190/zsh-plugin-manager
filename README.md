# zsh-plugin-manager


This is yet another plugin manager, because I did not find any that I was satisfied with.

If a plugin is prefixed with `async` the plugin manager will load it asynchronously through the use of [romkatv/zsh-defer](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-defer).

Focus is on simplicity and speed. That means it is not as polished as [zplug/zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) nor as customizable as [zdharma/zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit).

## Installation

It works by first sourcing the plugin manager. If you do not have it installed, you can put this snippet in your .zshrc to automatically install it:

```
if [[ ! -d ${ZDOTDIR}/plugins ]]; then
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/trobjo/zsh-plugin-manager 2> /dev/null "${ZDOTDIR}/plugins/trobjo/zsh-plugin-manager"
    command chmod g-rwX "${ZDOTDIR}/plugins"
fi
source "${ZDOTDIR}/plugins/trobjo/zsh-plugin-manager/zsh-plugin-manager.zsh"

```

It is now ready for managing plugins.

## Synchronous plugins and asynchronous plugins

You install plugins by first declaring them. Declaring a plugin simply means adding it to a list that will be loaded later. 
There are two lists and therefore two ways of loading plugins; synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous plugins are always sourced in the order they are declared. That is not guaranteed to be the case with asynchronous plugins.

Asynchronous plugins make the plugins load in the background and therefore make the prompt load way faster. That is especially useful on slow machines, but some plugins must be loaded on initialization, for example the prompt setup.

The syntax for declaring a synchronous plugin is as simple as:

```
plug trobjo/zsh-completions
```
Making a plugin load asynchronously works by adding `async` to the command. E.g:
```
plug async trobjo/zsh-goodies
```
After declaring 0 or more plugins you can initialize the plugin manager by calling `plug init` in your `.zshrc`. 
Plugins declared after `plug init` will not be loaded upon initialization of your shell.


## Other options
You can further qualify the installation of a plugin with the use of keywords.
The syntax is `plug [async] <plugin-github-name>[, <qualifier>:'<value>', ...]`.

That is qualifiers are separated by `, ` â€“ a comma followed by at least one space. The value should, if it contains other that alphabetic characters, be quoted with single quotes.

| Qualifier | Description |
|:-:|-|
|`if` |The expression will be evaluated by your shell and must return an exit code of 0 in order for the plugin to be installed and/or loaded.|
|`ignorelevel`|If you do not want to automatically source the plugin file, for example because it is a binary, you can set the `ignorelevel`.|
|`postinstall`|A shell expression that is run once after the installation.|
|`source`|File to source if the plugin is named differently than `github/name.plugin.zsh` or `github/name.zsh`|
|`postload`|Hook to run on every start after the plugin itself is sourced|
|`env`|Simple environment variables to export. Global|
|`where`|Alternative plugin location.|

## Example
Here is a short, working example:

```
if [[ ! -d ${ZDOTDIR}/plugins ]]; then
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/trobjo/zsh-plugin-manager 2> /dev/null "${ZDOTDIR}/plugins/trobjo/zsh-plugin-manager"
    command chmod g-rwX "${ZDOTDIR}/plugins"
    mkdir -p "${HOME}/.local/bin"
fi

source "${ZDOTDIR}/plugins/trobjo/zsh-plugin-manager/zsh-plugin-manager.zsh"

plug romkatv/gitstatus
plug trobjo/zsh-prompt-compact

plug async trobjo/zsh-completions
plug async skywind3000/z.lua,\
           if:'command -v lua',\
           env:'_ZL_CMD=h',\
           env:'_ZL_DATA=${ZDOTDIR}/zlua_data',\
           ignorelevel:ignore,\
           postload:'$(lua ${plugin_dir_local_location}/z.lua --init zsh enhanced once); _zlua_precmd() {(czmod --add "\${PWD:a}" &) }'
plug async 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trobjo/czmod-compiled/master/czmod',\
           if:'! command -v czmod && command -v lua',\
           ignorelevel:ignore,\
           postinstall:'chmod +x "${filename}" && mv ${filename} ${HOME}/.local/bin/'
plug async le0me55i/zsh-extract,\
           source:extract.plugin.zsh
plug async 'https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/download/0.26.0/fzf-0.26.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz',\
           if:'! command -v fzf',\
           ignorelevel:ignore,\
           postinstall:'tar zxvf ${filename} --directory ${HOME}/.local/bin/ && rm ${filename}'
plug async trobjo/Neovim-config,\
           if:'command -v nvim',\
           where:'$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim',\
           postinstall:'nvim +PlugInstall +qall; printf "\e[6 q\n\n"',\
           ignorelevel:ignore

plug init
```




There are probably a lot of bugs, as I have not tested it with any other setups than mine.
